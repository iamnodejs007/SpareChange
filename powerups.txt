note: may need to make these all active effects rather than traps

add 3 coins back (trap)
force opponent to skip turn (trap - don't find out until after they try to take their turn)
allow player to take from more than one stack (active)
opponent can only take 1 coin next turn (trap) or opponent takes fewer coins than they try to
redistribute the stacks (trap)
opponent forced to take from largest stack
opponent forced to take from smallest stack
